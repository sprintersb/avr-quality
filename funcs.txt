# Input for math-qual.sh are lines of comma-separated columns.
#
# 1st column: The function to test which has prototype
#
#    float FUNC (float)  or  float FUNC (float, float)
#
# 2nd and 3rd column specify the X interval.
# 4th and 5rd column specify the Y interval for binary functions.
# 6th column is optional for binary functions and specifies
# the X coordinate to be used in the plot. Valid are: x, y, abs, arg.

# The function FUNC must be such that avrtest_FUNC() is supported
# as a syscall in the avrtest core simulator.  This is required
# because the precise values like sinf(1.0) must be provided by
# some means, and in this context the means is an avrtest syscall.
# Supported functions are:
#
#	sinf, asinf, sinhf, asinhf,
# 	cosf, acosf, coshf, acoshf,
#	tanf, atanf, tanhf, atanhf,
#	sqrtf, cbrtf, expf, logf, log2f,
#	truncf, ceilf, floorf, roundf fabsf,
#
#	powf, atan2f, hypotf, fminf, fmaxf, fmodf,
#	mulf, divf, addf, subf.
#
# and similar for long double functions like sinl.
